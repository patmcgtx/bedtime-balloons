My second iOS app, a gameified kids' bedtime app released years ago as [Bedtime Balloons](https://www.roundtripsoftware.com/app/bedtime/).

This was pre-[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and coded entirely in [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C).  Heck, even [ARC](https://opensource.apple.com/source/clang/clang-211.10.1/src/tools/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html) was new at the time.

This was pre-[SpriteKti](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/), so the animations were in [cocos2d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos2d), now [Cocos2d-x](https://www.cocos.com/en/cocos2d-x).

Persistence in orignial-flavor [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/).
