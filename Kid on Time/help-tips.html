        <p class="question" id="background">
        Can I switch to other apps while this app is running?  What about locking the phone?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
        Yes.  Bedtime Balloons keeps track of the time even when running
        in the background or when the phone is locked.

        <p class="answer">
            <p>Work with your child to create a realistic schedule that he or she
                can follow.  Keep tweaking the time as needed.
            </p>
            <p>A minimum time of one minute can prevent a child from immediately
                skipping through a step.
            </p>

        <p class="question" id="notifications">
        Why does this app ask to send me notifications?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">When running in the background, this app will send you
        a notification if a step's time is running out.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
        If you want notifications but are not getting them, open the
        <em>Settings</em> app and find this app under <em>Notification Center</em>.
        Then enable notifications for this app.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question" id="music">
        How can I play music from another app while running through a routine?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
        Just start music from the other app and then switch back to Bedtime Balloons.
        The music will keep playing as long as the other app allows it.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question" id="pausing">
        Is there a way to pause a routine?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
        Yes, tap the screen twice with two fingers to pause the routine.
        This is a hidden feature, and may not want to share it with the kids.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question" id="otheruses">
        Can I use this app to help with chores or homework?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
        Yes.  Just select the "Use My Own Pictures" option when creating a routine.
        Then add pictures of chores, homework, or whatever you want.
