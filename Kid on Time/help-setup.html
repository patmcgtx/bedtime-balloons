        Create a routine for each night's schedule, for example
        a "Bath Night" routine or a "Quick to Bed" routine.

        Work with your child to create a realistic routine that he/she
        can do on his/her own.  Continue to adjust and tweak your
        routines as you get more experience with them.

        A routine has one or more tasks such as brushing teeth or
        taking a bath. Use the built-in tasks or create new ones
        with your own pictures.

              <li>Use a <b>maximum time</b> for cases like,
                "Get your pajamas on within five minutes."
            </li>
              <li>Use a <b>minimum time</b> for cases like,
                  "Keep brushing your teeth for two minutes."
            </li>
            <li>Use both or neither.  Sometimes a kid just needs
                  to know the next step without the time pressure.
